# gt-hw-pwa-offline-budget-tracker

## Description 

This is a homework requirement for GT Full Stack Flex Program. We are using PWA to create an offline capable budget tracker. You input the name of your transaction and the amount and then click if you are adding the expense or subtracting the expense. It then generates a chart with a table of your expenses. If you go offline, the app will save your transactions and when you go back online, it will generate them dynamically.
